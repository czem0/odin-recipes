        <h5>DESCRIPTION</h5>
        
        <p>This stuff real good! Bread and chease and stuff!</p>
        
        <br>WOW WEE!</br>
        
        <h5>INGREDIANTS</h5>
        
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)</li>
            <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
            <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional</li>
            <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>STEPS</h5>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone,
                 <br>preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it is nice and hot as well.</br></li>
            
            <br>
            
            <li>Make sauce: If you are using my sauce recipe, stir together the ingredients. 
                <br>The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza.</br> 
                You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.</li>

            </br>
            
            <li>Roll out the dough: Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard 
                <br>to roll, let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. For a large</br> 
                pizza, I like to roll my dough into about a 14-inch diameter circle.</li>

            </br>

            <li>Cook the pizza:
                If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide pizza into the center of
                <br>the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then rotate the pizza</br>
                halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for another 6-8 minutes, or until the
                <br>crust is golden brown and charred in spots.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Slice and serve:
                Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. Let the   
                <br>pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. Season with fresh</br> 
                oregano (optional). Serve while warm with a side salad.</li>

            </br>

            <li>Make the honey butter (optional): Stir together the softened
                <br>butter and honey, then serve alongside the pizza for crust dipping.</br></li>
        </ol>
